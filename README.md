# Library Vue

This is an architecture model just like [the original Library](https://github.com/arthurgregorio/library) but using VueJS and Spring Boot instead of JavaEE and JSF.

> This is a work in progress and until I finish the whole application, i recommend you to not use this in production or something.. For now is just a study repository.
